## Running tests

For now you need to run three commands to execute all tests.

Test the Node.js version:

```
npm test
```

Test the browser version with HTML5 routing:

```
npm run test-html5
```

Test the browser version with hash routing:

```
npm run test-hash
```

Note that the browser tests don't run automatically via Travis yet, they must be done manually.
